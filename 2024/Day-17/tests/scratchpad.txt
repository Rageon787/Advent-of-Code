Register A: 2024
Register B: 0
Register C: 0

Program: 2,4,1,2,7,5,1,7,4,4,0,3,5,5,3,0

Instruction 0:
bst operand = 4
combo = A  
B = B % A           # Brute force A to find 


instruction 1: bxl
bxl, operand = 1 
combo = 1
B ^= 1 


instruction 2: 
cdv, operand = 5
combo = B
C = A >> B            right shift of A by B  

instruction 3:
bxl, operand = 7
B ^= 7
abc
111 

instruction 4:
bxc, operand = 4 
B^=C                # the last 3 bits must be equal to program[i] after this instruction

therfore the last 3 bits of C must either be 0 or B^=C^=B


instruction 5:
adv, operand = 3 
A >> 3           # Before A became 0 here, it must've been some number in [0, 7] 

instruction 6:
out, operand = 5
print(B % 8)        # last 3 bits of B must be equal to program[i]

instruction 7:
jnz, operand = 0
goto instruction 0 if A != 0 
else stop here 








 B
^C
 101

B^7  101    000
     000    101
     --- or --- 
     101    101

if B^7 == 101       or if B^7 == 0
then, B = 010          then, B = 111




C = A >> B 
we know that B = ?...?010 and C = ?...?000 
000 = ?????? >> B

Then A = ?000??
